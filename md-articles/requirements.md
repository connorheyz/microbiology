## Education
Some microbiologists practice with two-year associate degrees in a scientific field such as chemistry or biology, but most have at least a four-year bachelor’s degree from a college or university. Typically, these degrees are given in areas such as microbiology, chemistry or biology. Some microbiologists gain master’s degrees, which require research and usually lead to teaching positions in universities or colleges, while others seek doctoral degrees. A doctoral degree, or Ph.D., serves to give a microbiologist a great amount of research experience and extensive schooling in the field of microbiology.

## Certification
To become a microbiologist, one must attain a bachelor’s degree in a related field such as biology, chemistry or physics. In most cases, a master’s degree, a Ph.D. or both can help give a microbiologist the upper hand in determining what he or she will do for a living and what his or her ultimate salary will be.
